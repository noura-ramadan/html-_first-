<font face ="computer" color="#8b008b" size ="10" ><u>There are a few major themes:</u></font>
<br />
<ol>


  <li>There is a strong interplay between architecture, operating systems and compiling.<br />
 The interrelationships and mutual support determine performance and efficient resource utilitation.<br /> </li>
   


<li> Reduced instruction set computers (RISC) offer some unique advantages over complex
 instruction set computers (CISC).<br /> Many CISCs, however, can be extended through microcode in a write-able control store.
 Today, I would compare ARM vs. x86 instead of SPARC vs. VAX.<br/> </li>


<li>Synchronous design dominates current commercial machine implementation.<br/> However, self-timed systems and micropipelines are viable,
 asynchronous alternatives to synchronous timing and a central clock.<br/> </li>


<li>Hardware systems are parallel.<br/> Software design and implementation has not kept up partly due to computer languages that are inherently
 sequential.<br/> Languages also need to be freed from the sequential von Neumann paradigm.<br/> Functional programming and dataflow architectures are two possible
 alternatives. Today, I would present Haskell in addition to Backus FP.<br/> </li>


</ol>
<p> <font face="cc" color ="#7fff00" size="3">My goal</font>, generally, is to teach students to think critically
 about computer architecture from multiple perspectives.<br/> I also hope to motivate non-von Neumann architectures and languages
.<br/> We’ve been stuck in the von Neumann paradigm for too long.<br/> Even von Neumann and Turing considered other approaches before each of these pioneers 
came to a premature and tragic end.

Labs in Columbus, Ohio.<br/> </p>
